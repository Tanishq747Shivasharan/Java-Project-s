# State-Board Electricity Management System.

## Introduction
The Electricity Management System is a Java-based application developed to automate and simplify the process of electricity billing and customer data management. This system enables users to input customer details, perform bill calculations based on usage, and generate payment information dynamically.

One of the key features of this system is its integration with a database, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of customer records and billing history. This ensures data consistency, easy access to historical information, and better management of billing operations.

Designed for utility service providers or educational purposes, the system aims to reduce manual work, minimize errors, and offer a user-friendly interface for handling electricity billing tasks.
